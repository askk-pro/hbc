### 📘 What is this Document Called in IT?

In IT and product development, the **document you're referring to** is best described as:

> **Pricing & Feature Comparison Document**
> *or*
> **Commercial Offer / Feature Matrix with Pricing Tiers**

When created for formal delivery to clients, especially in India, it's often labeled as:

> **Pricing Proposal with Feature Matrix**
> — or in government/corporate tenders: **Commercial BOM (Bill of Material)**

This complements your `FRS` (Functional Requirements Specification) by giving **plan-wise segmentation** of features and pricing.
