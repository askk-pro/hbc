### **Phased Monthly Cost Projection (INR)**  
*(Aligned with user growth from 100 to 15,000 users)*  

| **Phase** | **Timeframe** | **Users**       | **Tech Stack**                  | **Estimated Cost/Month** | **Key Cost Drivers**                |  
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|  
| **Phase 1** (Launch) | Months 1–3  | 100–2,000       | - Vercel Pro<br>- Supabase Pro<br>- Razorpay (low volume) | ₹18,000 – ₹22,000        | Payment gateway fees (low volume), fixed backend costs |  
| **Phase 2** (Growth) | Months 4–6  | 2,000–6,000     | - + Edge Functions<br>- + SMS/Email scaling | ₹25,000 – ₹35,000        | Transaction fees, compute resources, notifications |  
| **Phase 3** (Scale)  | Months 7–12 | 6,000–15,000    | - + Storage scaling<br>- + Realtime features | ₹35,000 – ₹50,000        | Media storage, realtime sync, payment processing |

### **Optimization Recommendations**  

#### **1. Cost-Effective Scaling**  
- **Supabase**:  
  - Use **Row-Level Security (RLS)** to minimize redundant API calls.  
  - Optimize queries with indexes (e.g., for `business_id`, `user_id`).  
  - *Savings*: Reduce compute costs by 20–30%.  

- **Vercel**:  
  - Enable **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** for business listings to reduce SSR load.  
  - *Savings*: Cut bandwidth costs by 15–20%.  

#### **2. Payment Gateway Savings**  
- **Razorpay**:  
  - Promote **UPI payments** (1% fee vs. 2% for cards).  
  - Batch process refunds to minimize transaction counts.  
  - *Savings*: Reduce fees by 30–50% for UPI-heavy users.  

#### **3. Notification Costs**  
- **SMS/Email**:  
  - Use **WhatsApp Business API** (₹0.25/message) for OTPs instead of SMS (₹0.30–0.50).  
  - Throttle non-critical emails (e.g., newsletters).  
  - *Savings*: Drop SMS costs by 40%.  

#### **4. Storage Optimization**  
- **Supabase Storage**:  
  - Compress images/videos (e.g., use `sharp` for images).  
  - Set TTL (Time-to-Live) for temporary files (e.g., invoices).  
  - *Savings*: Reduce storage needs by 50%.  

#### **5. Future-Proofing**  
- **Beyond 15K Users**:  
  - Migrate to **Supabase Enterprise** (custom pricing) for dedicated resources.  
  - Switch to **AWS Lambda** (pay-per-use) for edge functions if volume spikes.

### **Projected Annual Savings with Optimizations**  
| **Scenario**       | **Annual Cost (INR)** | **Savings**       |  
|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|  
| Without Optimizations | ₹4.2L – ₹6L          | –                 |  
| With Optimizations  | ₹3L – ₹4.2L           | **₹1.2L+ saved**  |

### **Actionable Checklist**  
1. **Immediate (Month 1–3)**:  
   - Enable RLS in Supabase.  
   - Configure Razorpay for UPI preference.  
2. **Mid-Term (Month 4–6)**:  
   - Implement image compression.  
   - Migrate OTPs to WhatsApp.  
3. **Long-Term (Month 7+)**:  
   - Audit queries/storage quarterly.  
   - Negotiate bulk discounts with Razorpay.
